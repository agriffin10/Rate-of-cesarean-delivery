          <p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm">almost 1 in 3 children will be born via cesarean delivery,</a> according to the CDC. Globally, the cesarean rate has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/newyork/ny.htm">increased from 7% to almost 21%, and is projected to hit 33% of all births by 2030.</a> The state of New York is currently ranked 12th nationally for its cesarean delivery rate <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/newyork/ny.htm">currently hovering around 33.6%.</a></p>

          <p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655">cesarean delivery,</a> sometimes referred to as a C-section, is a delivery method using surgical incisions in the abdomen and uterus. A C-section is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655">traditionally recommended when there are labor complications</a> such as the baby being in distress, issues with the baby’s presentation, or multiple babies. While a C-section can be a life-saving method for both the laboring parent and baby, it is a major medical procedure. As such, C-sections should not be used without medical necessity given the increased risks of <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/16-06-2021-caesarean-section-rates-continue-to-rise-amid-growing-inequalities-in-access">“heavy bleeding or infection, slower recovery times after childbirth, delays in establishing breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact, and increased likelihood of complications in future pregnancies,”</a> according to WHO, compared to vaginal births, sometimes referred to as natural births.</p>

          <p>Rates of cesarean sections vary tremendously, from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital, and state to state. But there are a number of reasons why an overall rate of cesarean delivery may be misleading. In a <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/c-section-rates/">2022 article,</a> Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, M.D., who specializes in Obstetrics and Gynecology, asserted that C-section statistics for doctors and hospitals may appear high since they tend to take on more high-risk deliveries if they are better equipped. </p>

          <p>In the state of New York, there are four levels of perinatal care offered within a region. According to the <a href="https://profiles.health.ny.gov/Hospital/designated_center/Regional+Perinatal+Center">New York State Department of Health,</a> there are four distinct levels of perinatal care issued by the hospitals within a designated region. Level 1 Perinatal Centers do not operate neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and provide care to low-risk laboring people and newborns; Level 2 and 3 Perinatal Centers operate NICUs and provide increasingly complex care; and Regional Perinatal Centers (RPCs) operate NICUs and assist in the most complex perinatal and postnatal care. </p>

          <p>However, even despite these specializations, the rates of cesearean deliveries out of total deliveries still vary from 26% to 44%. But within primary and repeat cesarian deliveries the spread is much smaller. Additionally, RPCs tend to see more primary cesarian deliveries than repeat cesarians which may be the result of primary cesarean deliveries being more complex preganices and deliveries.</p>

          <p>Gregory Ryan, M.D. who practices family medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center and counsels his patients through their labor process, explained “In the past, if you had a cesarean, you couldn’t even try to have a VBAC, a vaginal birth after cesarean. Now it's not necessarily true but some people still believe ‘once a C-section, always a C-section’ with the theory that the uterine lining is weakened by the previous surgery since there’s a scar there. So having a vaginal delivery with all its pressure could risk rupturing the uterus which would be life threatening. But many people still find success.” According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db359.htm">the rates of VBAC are actually increasing with 12.4% in 2016 and 13.3% in 2018.</a></p>

          <p>For some pregnancies, C-sections are still the only viable choice. But widespread stereotypes about C-sections persist, including that they are primarily by wealthy women, typically white and suburban, for easy deliveries to avoid effort, pain and vaginal damage. This sterotype is fundamentally untrue since recent studies have found that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-020-00842-3">Black patients had significantly higher rates of overall cesarian deliveries</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7931279/">“majority of the women [who had C-sections] (69.5%) belonged to urban areas of residence.”</a> Lastly, Dr. Ryan explained that in his practice, while he has seen patients elect to have a C-section opposed to a vaginal birth due to the percieved ease of it, the recovery of C-sections does tend to be longer and more difficult.</p>

          <p>Other studies have also found that laboring parents may be coerced into C-sections due to time and financial incentives. One study even found that cesarean deliveries peak in the early mornings, at lunch time, and before leaving for the day. The study concludes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25437713/">“factors other than medical necessity appear to have a marked association with both timing of delivery and rate of cesarean delivery and may affect up to one third of primary cesarean deliveries.”</a> In a 2019 Atlantic article, researchers also discovered that as physicians were paid more for C-sections, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/c-section-rate-high/600172/">rates of C-sections increased compared to vaginal deliveries.</a></p> 

          <p>The decision of whether or not to have a major medical proceedure should not come down to whether or not your physician wants to get home early or make an extra buck. But perhaps its shouldn’t happen either, just because a patient asks. For such a major medical proceedure with increased chances of complications, one would hope patients and physicials lean heaviest on medical necessity.<p>
